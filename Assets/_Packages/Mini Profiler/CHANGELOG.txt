Changelog
==============================================================================

Version 2.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Graphic huge performance improvement
* More precise average value calculation
* Smaller texture

Version 2.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Several performance improvements.
* Changed to new Unity UI. Better, faster and more configurable (suggestion by
Roger Domenech (@UChlab)).
* Visible property renamed to Collapsed. This is more straightforward, since
the panel wasn't really "invisible" when collapsed. Note that the property
state meaining is inverted.
* Keyboard shortcut is now a Component.
* Removed the Continue Watching on Collapsed property. This was a minor
feature highly unused.
* Removed Mini Profiler Container. Instead, now you can use any Unity's Layout
Group component like Vertical or Horizontal Layout Group. Remember to unset
the Child Force Expand Height property to make the collapse work properly.

Version 1.0
